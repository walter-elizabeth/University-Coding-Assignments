Outside of the loop, 'sum_of_cals' holds the value of 380, which is 2 * the last value in the list 'calories', or 2*calories[7].\n",
    "4. Instead of making a new variable, I modified the original list 'calories' and made sure to include the [ii] so that python knew that I wanted it to be an object (list) that can be iterated over in this loop and not just an integer value, and doubled all of the values in the list 'calories' that way. Then I was able to use the sum function on the (new) list 'calories' to create an integer variable 'sumcals' that was the sum of all the values in the list 'calories'."
